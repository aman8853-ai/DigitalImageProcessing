I have created a comprehensive README.md for the Shannon–Fano image compression project. The README includes:

Key Sections:
	1.	Overview and features
	2.	Requirements and usage instructions
	3.	Detailed explanation of how the Shannon–Fano algorithm works
	4.	Output examples and compression ratio analysis
	5.	Code structure breakdown
	6.	Algorithm complexity analysis

Highlights:
	1.	Clear, step-by-step explanation of the Shannon–Fano coding process
	2.	Instructions for using both built-in MATLAB images and custom images
	3.	Expected output format with examples
	4.	Discussion of compression performance compared to Huffman coding
	5.	Suggestions for production-level improvements
