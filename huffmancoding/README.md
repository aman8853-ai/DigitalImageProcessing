I’ve created a comprehensive README.md for the Huffman image compression project. The README includes:

Key Sections:
	1.	Overview and features
	2.	Requirements and usage instructions
	3.	Detailed explanation of how the algorithm works
	4.	Output examples and compression ratio information
	5.	Code structure breakdown
	6.	Algorithm complexity analysis

Highlights:
	1.	Clear, step-by-step explanation of the Huffman coding process
	2.	Instructions for using both built-in MATLAB images and custom images
	3.	Expected output format with examples
	4.	Discussion of compression performance for different image types
	5.	Suggestions for production-level improvements
