I’ve created a comprehensive README.md for the Tambola (Housie) ticket generator project. The README includes:

Key Sections:
	1.	Overview and features
	2.	Requirements and usage instructions
	3.	Detailed explanation of the ticket generation logic
	4.	Output examples with sample tickets
	5.	Code structure breakdown
	6.	Algorithm complexity analysis

Highlights:
	1.	Step-by-step explanation of Tambola ticket rules and constraints
	2.	Logic for generating valid tickets with correct number distribution
	3.	Support for generating single or multiple tickets
	4.	Well-formatted ticket output in a 3×9 grid
	5.	Suggestions for production-level improvements (GUI, PDF export, multiplayer support)
